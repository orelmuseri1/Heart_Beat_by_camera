# Heart_Beat_by_camera

A solo project for nostalgia, the Idia is to detecet pulse rate by camera only, by this steps:
1) detecet faces.
2) detect middle of forehead.
3) make a list of all the green color in the point you found.
4) check changes in the colors for pulse.

TBD:
1) need to make the pulse more accurate.
2) need to make it detecet more than one ( already detect all the faces but need to check pulse for all of them).
